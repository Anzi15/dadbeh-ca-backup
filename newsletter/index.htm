<p>That patient, Terry, had lived on the streets for 15 years, had terminal cancer, and was repeatedly refused access to proper palliative care. It was too little too late.</p>
<p>Deeply affected by Terry&rsquo;s loss, Dr. Dosani realized that while we all have equal access to healthcare in Canada, it doesn&rsquo;t mean we have equitable access. And so he pledged to inspire change.</p>
<p>To complement REALTORS Care<sup>&reg;</sup> Week 2021, we join Dr. Dosani to gain a front-line perspective of the inequities facing homeless, poor, and vulnerably-housed Canadians. We look at housing as a healthcare issue, how we can cure it through policy, and how we can tap into our own vulnerability to ensure no one has to fall through the cracks.</p></div>
